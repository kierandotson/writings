If you wait until you cannot see the stars

Close your eyes and walk 100 miles in a spiral

Let go of everything you held on to

And try to get back home

.

You may find a glass-still lake, without joy

Damp and cold, and creaking

The blankness of strangers' faces

Calm or angry or I don't know

.

You may find the last world war

And monsters hidden in your daughter's closet

The terror of your existence, of our existence

Or the existence of anything at all

.

And you may find peace

In the waiting room of the doctor who will listen to your heart

In the call of the owl, in the dead of the night

When you wake up at 3AM to the baby's cries

Or your dog, pawing at your shoulder

.

Between your gasps for air there will be deep, clean breaths

There will be rest and snow and rain, and rivers

Dry, hot asphalt, long rides home

And rusty hinges, on half-painted sheds

.

And you will find that

If you keep your eyes open

.

The stars will see you

And home will find you
