# First post

You can add new markdown files under \`content/blog/\`, \`content/poems/\`, or \`content/philosophy/\`. After you run \`npm run build\` (or deploy with your git workflow), new posts will appear on the site.

Use **frontmatter** at the top of each file:

- \`title\` — shown in lists and on the post
- \`date\` — for ordering and display
- \`excerpt\` — optional summary for listing pages

Then write your content in markdown below the closing \`---\`.
`;export{n as default};
